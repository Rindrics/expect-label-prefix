# require-label-prefix-single

Inspired by: [trstringer/require-label-prefix](https://github.com/trstringer/require-label-prefix)

## What it does

Checks whether GitHub issue or pull request have label with specific prefix

This action is inspired by [@trstringer's](https://github.com/trstringer/require-label-prefix) but differs from that one:
This action handles only a single issue or pull request just emitted an event (does NOT scan the entire repo).
